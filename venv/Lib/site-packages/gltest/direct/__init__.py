"""
Native Python test runner for GenLayer intelligent contracts.

Runs contracts directly in Python without WASM/simulator, providing
Foundry-style cheatcodes and fast test execution.

Usage:
    from gltest.direct import VMContext, deploy_contract

    def test_transfer():
        vm = VMContext()
        with vm.activate():
            token = deploy_contract("path/to/Token.py", vm, owner)
            vm.sender = alice
            token.transfer(bob, 100)
            assert token.balances[bob] == 100
